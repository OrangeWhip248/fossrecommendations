# Intro
Phones are a very important part of our everyday lives and, sadly, a very trackable one as well. This guide will show you how to have a cheap phone with good specs and functionality that's untrackable. 

# MicroG
An implementation of the google play services without tracking

# Operating Systems

Calyx OS (Best choice!): Default Android without tracking. Runs everything, easy setup. Preinstalled MicroG.

Supports: https://calyxos.org/docs/guide/device-support

Graphene OS: Also based on android, supports less but more private. No MicroG.

Supports:
https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support

Lineage OS: Based on android but with a different Linux kernel. Manual MicroG setup, more device support

Supports:
https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/

# Hardware
Both Calyx and Graphene only support pixels. They are very cheap and a great choice. Please note:

NEVER BUY A PHONE FROM VERIZON!
They lock the bootloaders, making this all impossible

Here is a list of phones preinstalled with secure operating systems. This is not reccomended as they are more pricey and usually worse specs
